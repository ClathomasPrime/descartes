Out of 39 test cases:
-39 have a single argument of the same type.
-11 refer to the compareTo method of another type, entirely or in part.
-7 refer to weird function calls which are not called compareTo.
-1 involves a string concatenation of fields.
-33 involve comparison of fields, out of which 20 involve more than one.
-2 involve loops.
-1 checks for aliasing.
-8 check for nullness.
-1 was too strange to understand.

Release versions??? Not important, grab everything.
